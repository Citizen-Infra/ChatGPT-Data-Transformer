**# Portable Intellectual History Transformer**

Your AI conversation history belongs to you. This tool converts your ChatGPT data export into a local MCP (Model Context Protocol) server, giving Claude direct access to search and reference your full conversation history — no cloud, no third-party storage, no data leaving your machine.

**## What it does**

You export your data from ChatGPT, run it through the transformer, and get a fully functional MCP server that connects to Claude Desktop. Claude gains tools like `search_evidence`, `get_conversation`, and `get_evidence_by_id` — meaning it can pull context from thousands of past conversations as naturally as searching the web.

Your intellectual history becomes portable infrastructure instead of platform lock-in.

**## Why**

Every conversation you've had with ChatGPT — the context you've built, the projects you've explored, the thinking you've developed — lives on their servers. If you switch to Claude or any other platform, you start from zero. This tool closes that gap. Your history follows you.

**## How it works**

1. Download your ChatGPT data export (Settings → Export Data → download the JSON)
2. Run the transformer to convert and index your conversations
3. Connect the generated MCP server to Claude Desktop
4. Claude can now search and reference your full conversation history

Data stays local. Nothing is uploaded. The interface is Claude itself — no new UI to learn.
